She reminded the crew of our shared purpose and the hope we bring to the unknown. It’s this very spirit that continues to fuel our journey into the stars. Still, even as we approach the unknown, the weight of responsibility never lessens. It’s a constant balancing act between exploration and caution, between wonder and duty."
